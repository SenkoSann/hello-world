# hello-world
I'm following some github tutorial lol, I hope to use this as a storage site for my files in case I lose them on my computer.
I'm also using this because it has a very useful branch feature to test your code before "commiting" it to your main.
I also want to use this as a module I can require from somewhere so i dont have to commit my changes to a server like heroku's vps service.
At the moment it is the day before halloween 2021, I am 15 and coding is quite fascinating. I just started and found it fun that if you learn the language of a computer you can do so many things on a machine. Software developing is really cool! At the moment I make discord bots and roblox games. The languages I use right now are javascript for discord (discord.js), and roblox lua (which I think is simplified as they have built in functions specifically for their game creator application called Roblox Studio). 
I wrote this huh time to continue my journey! hahhaa damn this all seems so complicated !!
